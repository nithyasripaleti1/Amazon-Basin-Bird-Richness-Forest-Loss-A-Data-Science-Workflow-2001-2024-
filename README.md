# Amazon Basin Bird Richness & Forest Loss: A Data-Science Workflow (2001–2024)

This repository contains the full data-science pipeline developed to integrate
Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) bird occurrence data with Global
Forest Watch (GFW) forest loss statistics for the Amazon Basin from 2001–2024.

The project demonstrates:
- Acquisition of multi-million–row biodiversity datasets
- API-based retrieval of satellite-derived forest loss statistics
- Spatial/temporal filtering and cleaning
- Annual aggregation of species richness and observation effort
- Data integration into a unified analysis-ready dataset
- Statistical modeling (correlation, regression, lag analysis)
- Bias-aware interpretation of ecological big data
